Mission:
That it is not so difficult to start programming with this magnificent open-source engine focused on 2D.

We want 3 things:

1. That if it is the first time entering the world of development with languages ​​focused on Python, you can take a good first step.

2. That you can learn by feeding yourself with our easy-to-understand and modify objects

3. Correct any technical/physical failure of the Godot engine
