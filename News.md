# There is not a DevGarden Update (08/04/2023 - 12:30 PM COL - DevMax)
When I was developing an easter egg of the "Test" level, my pc shut down when I was compiling (I didn't have it on battery), causing the project to not save correctly and to get corrupted...

When I turned it back on, the "Test" scene didn't open, I thought it was a mistake and I tried to open it on my own, but... it didn't open.

I executed it and it opened satisfactorily but it closed when the scene started

Create a new scene and try to put "Test" as a child of the node but, no.

I looked at the debugger and OH SURPRISE, 2487 Errors (I'm not exaggerating, really). I don't quite understand your translation or your error code but I think it was that it didn't load the assets and it corrupted everything

Then restart everything, even my pc, but no. I created a new project and the same thing came out, I deleted the "Test" node, I made some changes and OH SURPRISE, I was able to run everything fine, I created a new scene and everything as saved.

I still don't know what happened but it wasn't really like that, all the settings and part of the scripts were corrupted

I will last a long time correcting everything AND MORE that I will take care of myself much more

Today (04/08/2023) at 3:00 PM (Colombian time) I will give the first RELEASE of the SDK in the form of a plugin for godot

I will also take the opportunity to polish bugs, put images in the classes and translate the SDK into Spanish (I speak Spanish and everything in English is translated by Google translator)
